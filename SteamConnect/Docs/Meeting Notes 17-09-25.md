### Discussion
Gave presentation regarding current state of our project. We received feedback from both the class and Professor Mohanty on how we could improve our project, include new details on data gathering methods and narrowing down own final goal of the project.

### Steam Review Graph
Travis mentioned that Steam just released their new system that provides a graph of the reviews for a specific game, and that graph can be manipulated to show specific days rather than only months. This will be useful for looking at game reviews on Steam.

Example: Fallout 4 review data

### Changes to the Project
- Narrow the goal to focus on reviews and game data
- Confirmation that we are essentially analyzing marketing data
- Don't focus on user specific data unless necessary, too much to handle
- "Ignore VAC ban data, too much for the scope of this project" - Mohanty
