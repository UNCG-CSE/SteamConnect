### Discussion
We need to narrow down how exactly we want to grade the games that we examine. After talking about it some after class today, we still have a few things that definitely need to be done before we can proceed.

### Current Player Count
We've had the issue for a while now that we do not have current, up-to-date data for current player counts. A solution that could be proposed is using Steam's app data for player count over the course of a month, use that data to select the most populated time and then re-pull our data at that specific time. That was, we can get more current scores and player counts at peak times for our analysis. 

### Ideas for more visualization
To begin, a good idea would be to either check the app tags or pull a new data set with those tags and sort them by genre. Then, we can use those catoegories of tags to calculate and average score of early access game in x category. This will make for a good basis of information showing which early access genres are not performing as well as others. From there, we can focus on the most successful and least successful and focus on individual games.

For now, I (Jonathan) will keep working on the grading system and start looking into what time frame we should pull our data. I will update this document with my finding so that we can begin working with it.
