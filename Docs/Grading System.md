# Notes for Game Success Grading System

First, we need to determine what different attributes we can use to determine how successful a game is.
- Score rank
- Owners 
- Players
- Release date
- Price

#### Score Rank

Score rank can easily be used to determine somewhat of a success score on its own. However, Steam reviews are known for being exploited and being "review bombed," where unhappy players will gather to try and drop a games' score as much as possible. While being able to factor this out completely might be difficult, using the score rank in conjunction with other methods of determining success will nullify the effect of review bombing.

#### Owners & Players

Over time, games will lose the amount of players it has had since launching day. Using owners and players, we could determine the average number of players continuing to play the game in comparison to how many purchased it. Depending on how old the game is, this number could vary. We could use the release date and the current date and player count to determine a score for how many retained players the game has, with older games not being scored as harshly, as player count would drop over time regardless.

#### Owners & Price

A way to determine success could easily be checked through the ownership of the game compared to the price of the game, estimating a total income from the amount of purchases of the game. Of course, like other methods, this could not represent the success of a game fully, as it could have sold well, but flopped in the eyes of the gaming community. 

#### Overall Grading

Using all of these different methods together, we could combine either an average of the scores or a combined total so go by. A very successful game would be one that has a high rating from players, a high percentage of players still playing the game and was very profitable. Not so successful games would be the opposite, of course, having low scores, low concurrent players and not resulting in a high profit. Any of these can be used together in combination to determine score, it just leads up to which would be best for us to implement. We will likely need to create new columns to contain all of these comparisons and information in which we can sort to determine success rate.
