## Goals & Duties

- Found average price per game amongst our merged dataset (Oct 15th, 2017, 1-5am)  https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/SteamConnect/blob/master/code/early_access_sorting.ipynb 
- Updated my ipython notebook to Jupyter so that my partners wouldnâ€™t have to keep deleting, recloning the repository just each time I commited/pushed something onto the repository. (Wednesday Oct 18th , 2017, 9 pm)
