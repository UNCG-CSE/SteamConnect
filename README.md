## Goal
The overall goal of SteamConnect will be to examien and analyze Steam data gathered through various data sets and compare them to determine what genres or categories of games are more successful than others and why. This analysis will be done with mainly two major sources within Steam: early access games and Steam's review system. Using these two, we will be able to answer questions regarding the success or failure of early access and standard release games and hopefully pinpoint the reasons behind either.

#### Early Access Games
SteamConnect will examine game applications listen on Steam as early access games and analyze data for each. Early access games have a somewhat negative reputation in the gaming community, as it is easy for developers to simply drop development on an early access game, leaving users with a permanently unfinished game. Our analysis will look at tags and genres of each early access game, overall and recent reviews, updates and so on. This information will be useful in finding what types of early access games are successful in comparison to others.

#### Steam Reviews
SteamConnect will actively examine and analyze Steam application reviews. Steam users may leave either a positive or negative review, with a text field open for them to further explain their thoughts on a specific game. These reviews may then be compared with application tags submitted for the games, allowing us to see which types of games are more successful than others. Steam Review Graphing will allow for specific dates to be specified, targetting large influx of reviews, reviews bombs and poorly/negatively received updates.

## Data
- Brigham Young University Steam User Data Set (2016)
- Steam Customer Review System
- Steam Web API
- SteamDB

#### Brigham Young University Data Set
The Brigham Young University data set contains information regarding applications data and user data for the year 2016. The data was gethered and used for the 2016 ACM Internet Measurement Conference article by Mark O'Neill, Justin Wu, Elham Vaziripour, and Daniel Zappala. The BYU website also has listed all of the table and attribute descriptions for the data set. It has an immense amount of information, totaling ~160gb of data.
