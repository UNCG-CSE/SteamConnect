# SteamConnect
The goal of SteamConnect will be to examine and analyze Steam data gathered in 2016, such as Steam user data and their playtime and determine trends in gaming history with the application's users. This data can also be cross-examined with real-time data gathered by the SteamDB to examine how this data has changed over time. Different variables, such as concurrent players, most played games and trending games can be examined to see the change over the course of a year with users' game choices and popularity. The main data set being used is the Steam Dataset gathered by Brigham Young University (17gb). Their website holds information about each variable present in the data set. We will also examine SteamDB for real-time statistics from Steam itself and the current trends and statistics for specific games.
