## Goals & Duties
#### Amir
- Provided .md document with potential visualizing tool to use (this was just before we all went over plotly in class). As well as listed potential ways on how to implement each of them and attached links to each url. (Oct 8, 2017, 1 am) https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/SteamConnect/tree/master/Visualization 
- Did some data wrangling with the price column so that the values could be accessed and manipulated (Oct 15th, 2017, 1-5am)  https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/SteamConnect/blob/master/code/early_access_sorting.ipynb 
- Found average price per game amongst our merged dataset (Oct 15th, 2017, 1-5am)  https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/SteamConnect/blob/master/code/early_access_sorting.ipynb 
- Updated my ipython notebook to Jupyter so that my partners wouldnâ€™t have to keep deleting, recloning the repository just each time I commited/pushed something onto the repository. (Wednesday Oct 18th , 2017, 9 pm) 
- Fixed Issue with reading in and displaying steamid. Read csv in as a list, and then converted it into a dataframe (Thursday Oct 19th, 2017, 1 am)  https://github.com/UNCG-CSE/SteamConnect/blob/master/code/early_access_sorting.ipynb 
+ Further Goals include but not limited to: Continuing helping wrangle data, build appropriate graphs with meaningful data.

#### Jonathan
- Documentation & notekeeping
  - Formatting and preparing meeting notes, ideas, README
- Game success grading system planning/development
  - Grading system notes doc (found in docs folder)
  - Formatting data to be manipulated for grading
  - Note: I've been working on it and wrote out my ideas for everyone to look at, feel free to chime in or give suggestions. I would have more done on it right now, but the amount of assignments and projects I have are a little overwhelming. When we solidify what we want to use for grading, I can get started.
