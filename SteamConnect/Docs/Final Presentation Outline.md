1. Intro
2. Purpose of SteamConnect
    * General idea of how Steam works
    * Null hypothesis
    * "No difference in score for early access/normal games"
3. Datasets 
    * Attributes (and their weird formatting)
    * Statistics for games
4. Comparisons
    * Between early access, ex early access, full games
5. Visualization
    * Primarily large graphs showing info
    * Correlation heatmap
6. Results
7. Challenges
    * Pulling data at peak times
    * Sales during holiday times affect price
    * Some early access titles aren't games (didn't anticipate software, etc.)
