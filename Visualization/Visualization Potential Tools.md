Here are the some potential visualization tools we can use to display our data. Also included is the URL link to the those design tools. 

1. DataHero - Very nice data visualization tool. However it is only free for a 14-day free trial. 
Cost: Free (14 days per new user) 14 * 4 = 56 days. Which is approx how long we need it for :) 
Link: https://datahero.com/

2. Plotly - This is one of the tools mentioned by Dr. Mohanty. He said there is a limited amount of graphs that they allow you to build. Again, if each of us signs up to like 10 free graphs. That will mean we have 40 free graphs we can build.

3. Tableau Public - 10 GB of free storage, drag-n-drop interface, 15 million rows per workbook (csv files, google sheet, R, statistical files, json files, excel) 
Cost: Free
